<p>Objective of swap lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“reduce uncertainty among market participants as to whether and when these arrangements would be renewed” (FOMC 2013, 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“as the deadline grew closer, the markets would start to worry about whether the swap-line was going to be there or not” (Sheets in FOMC 2010b, 16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Kocherlakota: &gt; renewal of a temporal line could be understood as the Fed being “concerned about things”, while with a permanent facility the FOMC “[doesn’t] really have to worry as much about the signaling content of our decision” (FOMC 2013, 12).</p>

<li><p>Creative re-deployment &gt; „I think a lot of the programmes that we have are actually open ended. The discount window is open ended in the sense that it‘s limited only by the amount of collateral the banks post there“ (FOMC 2008, 17)</p></li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>liquidity swap lines not mere functionalist response to problem in off-shore dollar markets (Mehrling 2013, Murau 2018)</li>
<li><em>apppear</em> as functionalist, however bricolage lets uncover the precise practices used and the fragilities entailed (no rationalist, optimal soution)</li>
<li>design by bricolage: neither praise for ingenuity (Bernanke, Geithner, Paulson (2019), nor power grabbing (Jacobs, King 2016)</li>
